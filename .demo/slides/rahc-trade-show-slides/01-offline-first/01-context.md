# Why Offline-First Matters

---

## The Rural Alberta Reality

🏔️ **Remote Communities**
- 2+ hours to nearest clinic
- Spotty cell coverage
- No internet in emergencies

---

## The Problem

❌ Most health apps:
- Require constant internet
- Crash when offline
- Store nothing locally

---

## Our Approach

✅ **Built for Rural Alberta**
> "If it doesn't work offline, it doesn't work for rural Albertans."

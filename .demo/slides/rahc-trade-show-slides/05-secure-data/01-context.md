# Why Secure Data Storage Matters

---

## Healthcare Data is Sensitive

**What we store:**
- 📞 Phone numbers
- 🏥 Medical history
- 💊 Symptoms and conditions
- 👤 Personal information

**Legal requirements:**
- PIPEDA (Canadian privacy law)
- HIPAA considerations
- Alberta Health regulations

---

## The Risk

**Without encryption:**
- Anyone with device access sees data
- Shared devices leak information
- Lost phones = data breach

**Real scenario:**
- Elderly user shares device with family
- Phone number stored in plain text
- Family members can access health info

## Our Standard

**End-to-end encryption**
> Your data is locked. Only you have the key.

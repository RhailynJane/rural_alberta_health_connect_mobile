# Why Smart Notifications Matter

---

## The Rural Healthcare Challenge

**Managing health remotely is hard:**
- 💊 Remember medications
- 📅 Track appointments
- 🩺 Follow doctor's instructions
- 📝 Log symptoms daily

**Rural patients travel far:**
- Can't easily "drop by" the clinic
- Need to stay on top of health at home

---

## Common Problem

Most reminder apps are generic:
- ❌ "Take medicine" (which one?)
- ❌ Notifications you ignore
- ❌ No connection to your health data

---

## Our Approach

**Context-aware health reminders**
> Notifications that understand your health journey

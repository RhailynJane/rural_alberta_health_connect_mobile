# Why Data Status Matters

---

## The Trust Problem

**Users need to know:**
- 🔄 Is this information current?
- 📱 Am I seeing live or cached data?
- ⚠️ Should I trust this clinic's hours?

**Rural reality:**
- Spotty connections
- Data might be hours old
- Clinic hours change

---

## The Danger

**Scenario:**
- User sees clinic is "Open"
- Data is 3 hours old (cached)
- Drives 1 hour to clinic
- **Clinic is closed**

❌ Wasted time
❌ Lost trust
❌ Potentially dangerous delay

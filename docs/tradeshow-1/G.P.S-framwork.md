# The G.P.S. Communication Framework

## 1. Core Philosophy

The G.P.S. (Guide, Point, Show) framework is a system for answering questions in a way that is strategic, confident, and conversational. It moves beyond simply providing a correct answer to leading a discussion, controlling the narrative, and making your points memorable.

The goal is to stop reciting memorized facts and start generating compelling answers on the fly.

## 2. The Core Components

| Component | Function               | Purpose                    | Key Technique          |
| :-------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **G**uide | Your **Opener**        | To provide **Relevance**   | Setting the Stage      |
| **P**oint | Your **Direct Answer** | To provide **Clarity**     | The Simple Explanation |
| **S**how  | Your **Closer**        | To provide **Credibility** | Landing with Proof     |

## 3. Application by Question Type

### Answering 'What' Questions (Definition)

The goal is to establish why the term is relevant before you define it.

- **Formula:** `G (Relevance)` ➡️ `P (Simple Definition)` ➡️ `S (Analogy/Proof)`
- **Example:** "What is on-device ML?"
  > **(G)** "For rural users with unreliable internet, waiting for a cloud server isn't an option. We needed the AI to work instantly, anywhere."
  > **(P)** "So, on-device ML is an AI model that runs directly on the user's phone, no internet required."
  > **(S)** "It works just like a downloaded dictionary app—you can look up words offline because the data is already there."

### Answering 'How' Questions (Process)

The goal is to state the desired outcome of the process before you explain the steps.

- **Formula:** `G (Goal)` ➡️ `P (Action/Steps)` ➡️ `S (Outcome/Proof)`
- **Example:** "How does a user submit an injury photo?"
  > **(G)** "Our main goal was to make this process incredibly simple for someone who might be stressed or in pain."
  > **(P)** "The user just opens the app and taps one button to take a photo."
  > **(S)** "The entire flow is three taps, and we timed it at under 30 seconds from opening the app to getting a result."

### Answering 'Why' Questions (Purpose)

The goal is to frame your decision around the core problem you were trying to solve.

- **Formula:** `G (Core Problem)` ➡️ `P (Specific Choice)` ➡️ `S (Benefit/Proof)`
- **Example:** "Why did you choose Convex for your backend?"
  > **(G)** "A key part of our app is the real-time chat between a patient and doctor, which had to be seamless, even on a bad connection."
  > **(P)** "We chose Convex because it’s a modern backend platform with those real-time capabilities built-in."
  > **(S)** "This choice saved us a huge amount of development time. Implementing the real-time chat took less than a day, whereas with a traditional setup, it could have taken a week."

## 4. Advanced Technique: Adapting Your Context (The 'G' Step)

The most effective context is tailored to your listener. Use the **"Why Triangle" (Value, User, Risk)** to generate the right context for the right person.

| If your listener is a... | They care about...            | Your 'G' (Context) should focus on...                  |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Business Person**      | The bottom line, the mission. | **VALUE** (efficiency, scalability, cost)              |
| **Technical Peer**       | The code, the architecture.   | **RISK** (stability, security, maintainability)        |
| **End User / Clinician** | The experience, the benefit.  | **USER** (ease-of-use, privacy, solving their problem) |

## 5. Application for Behavioral Interviews (The STAR Method Upgrade)

The G.P.S. framework is a more conversational and strategic version of the standard STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).

| G.P.S. Component | STAR Equivalent  | Purpose in an Interview                                            |
| :--------------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **G**uide        | Situation + Task | Set the stage by explaining the context, the stakes, and the goal. |
| **P**oint        | Action           | Give a direct answer about the specific, key action you took.      |
| **S**how         | Result           | Land with proof of the tangible outcome, metric, or learning.      |

### Example: "Tell me about a time you faced a major technical challenge."

> **(G - Set the Stage):** "In Sprint 1 of our health app, our core feature—the AI assessment—was completely blocked. The AI's safety filters were flagging legitimate medical terms like 'burn injury', preventing the app from working."
>
> **(P - The Direct Answer):** "I took ownership of the problem and began systematically re-engineering our system prompts. I tested dozens of variations to understand the AI's behavior."
>
> **(S - Land with Proof):** "The result was that we unblocked the entire feature. My final prompt design, which frames the AI as an emergency physician, became a core part of our architecture and was the key to shipping our main feature on time."
